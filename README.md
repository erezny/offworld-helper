# Offworld trading company helper

Helps with scenario games to plan engineer hires and HQ type.

## How to use

Set the commodity prices at the top of the table to the starting prices in your game.

Switch between the HQ types using the buttons at the top right of the page.

Hire engineers and plan your resource grabs based on the expenses predicted by this model.

## Caveats

The metal mine, quarry, and solar condenser show all possible production, which is rare in regular gameplay.

No production multipliers are accounted for.

Scientific HQ type still lists the input resources, when they can be

## Installation

**1. Clone this repo:**

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate.git my-app
cd my-app
```


**2. Make it your own:**

```sh
rm -rf .git && git init && npm init
```

> :information_source: This re-initializes the repo and sets up your NPM project.


**3. Install the dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

> You're done installing! Now let's get started developing.



## Development Workflow


**4. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.

**5. Testing with `mocha`, `karma`, `chai`, `sinon` via `phantomjs`:**

```sh
npm test
```

> üåü This also instruments the code in `src/` using [isparta](https://github.com/douglasduteil/isparta), giving you pretty code coverage statistics at the end of your tests! If you want to see detailed coverage information, a full HTML report is placed into `coverage/`.

**6. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```

> You can now deploy the contents of the `build` directory to production!
>
> **[Surge.sh](https://surge.sh) Example:** `surge ./build -d my-app.surge.sh`
> 
> **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/) Example:** `netlify deploy`
>
> [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate)


**5. Start local production server with [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve):**

```sh
npm start
```

> This is to simulate a production (CDN) server with gzip. It just serves up the contents of `./build`.

## Structure

Apps are built up from simple units of functionality called Components. A Component is responsible for rendering a small part of an application, given some input data called `props`, generally passed in as attributes in JSX. A component can be as simple as:

```js
class Link extends Component {
  render({ to, children }) {
    return <a href={ to }>{ children }</a>;
  }
}
// usage:
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
```

## CSS Modules

This project is set up to support [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).  By default, styles in `src/style` are **global** (not using CSS Modules) to make global declarations, imports and helpers easy to declare.  Styles in `src/components` are loaded as CSS Modules via [Webpack's css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#css-modules).  Modular CSS namespaces class names, and when imported into JavaScript returns a mapping of canonical (unmodified) CSS classes to their local (namespaced/suffixed) counterparts.

When imported, this LESS/CSS:

```css
.redText { color:red; }
.blueText { color:blue; }
```

... returns the following map:

```js
import styles from './style.css';
console.log(styles);
// {
//   redText: 'redText_local_9gt72',
//   blueText: 'blueText_local_9gt72'
// }
```

Note that the suffix for local classNames is generated based on an md5 hash of the file. Changing the file changes the hash.

## Handling URLS

:information_desk_person: This project contains a basic two-page app with [URL routing](http://git.io/preact-router).

Pages are just regular components that get mounted when you navigate to a certain URL. Any URL parameters get passed to the component as `props`.

Defining what component(s) to load for a given URL is easy and declarative. You can even mix-and-match URL parameters and normal props.

```js
<Router>
  <A path="/" />
  <B path="/b" id="42" />
  <C path="/c/:id" />
</Router>
```

## React Compatibility

This project includes [preact-compat] alias in as `react` and `react-dom` right out-of-the-box.  This means you can install and use third-party React components, and they will use Preact automatically!  It also means that if you _don't_ install third-party React components, `preact-compat` doesn't get included in your JavaScript bundle - it's free if you don't use it üëç
